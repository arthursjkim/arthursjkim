# Welcome Coders, Collaboraters, and Conquerors

My name is Arthur Kim and I am a data scientist with a background in healthcare 🏥. I was a healthcare consultant for three years, but I decided to switch into data science and attended Flatiron School Data Science Bootcamp (graduated Sept 2021). Now I am on a quest to find a job!

Some of my technical skills include:
* Python 🐍
* Pandas 🐼
* SQL 🗒️
* NumPy 💯
* Scikit-Learn ⚙️

Currently, I am participating in the [Tractor Supply’s “Life out Here” AI/ML Hackathon](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/tractor-supply-hackathon/) with my fellow bootcamp graduates:
* [Tony Bai](https://github.com/tm4gic)
* [Mia Fryer](https://github.com/miazfryer)
* [Eddie Lin](https://github.com/RedDragonfruit)
* [Ian Sharff](https://github.com/iansharff)

The current project is on optimizing price for the company's products using time series model.
